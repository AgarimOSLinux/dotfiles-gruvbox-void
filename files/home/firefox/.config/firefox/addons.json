Block ads, stop trackers and speed up websites.","fullDescription":"Ghostery counts more than 100+ million downloads worldwide.\n\nGhostery for Firefox provides safe, fast, and clutter-free browsing for free. The browser extension upgrades your Firefox browser and supplies full adblock functionality, stops trackers from accessing your personal data, and annoying cookie consent pop-ups.\n\nGhostery has three main components:\n* Ad-Blocking - blocks all ads on websites you visit with your Firefox browser, including Youtube and Facebook, helping you to focus only on the information important to you.\n* Anti-Tracking - stops trackers’ ability to collect your personal data, replacing it with random values and anonymizing your identity for data brokers. If you see a need to unblock individual trackers, we developed this option. The reasons are up to you!\n* Never-Consent - automatically removes intrusive cookie popups and expresses dissent to online tracking. This unequaled feature adds convenience to each website visit and acts like your privacy advocate towards content providers while using Firefox.\n\nGhostery delivers the online privacy protection our users have come to know and love while minimising the need for customisation and maintenance.\n\nAs Ghostery is more than an ad-blocker, it comes with exceptional additional features, not found in any other ad-blocking extension:\n* Trackers information on any website your visit, informing you about the number of trackers, their type, and the company operating them.\n* Trackers Preview on search engine result pages - displaying tracker information even before you visit a page. You can safely make the choice to visit it, as Ghostery will stop trackers expecting you on the landing page.\n* WhoTracks.Me - Owning and operating the largest database of trackers allows Ghostery to update tracker information fast and reliably for all users.\n* Managing your adblock, antitracking, and cookie popup removal function in one click.\n\nMoreover, Ghostery is:\n* Open source\n* Supported by thousands of contributors worldwide\n* Free to use forever","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/290/290017.png?modified=1700136255","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/290/290017.jpg?modified=1700136255","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Tracker & Ad Blocker\r\nBrowser the web safer, faster and with less ads."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/290/290018.png?modified=1700136253","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/290/290018.jpg?modified=1700136253","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"No more annoying ads\r\nRemoves all advertising and promotional content from website you visit."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/290/290019.png?modified=1700136252","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/290/290019.jpg?modified=1700136252","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"No more cookie popups\r\nGhostery's feature \"Never-Consent\" automates the interaction with consent dialogs, expressing dissent to tracking."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/290/290020.png?modified=1700136252","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/290/290020.jpg?modified=1700136252","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Anti-Tracking technology\r\nGhostery blocks trackers, ads and popups making your browsing faster, safer and transparent."}],"homepageURL":"http://www.ghostery.com/","supportURL":"https://www.ghostery.com/support/","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.2987,"reviewCount":1260,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":15374,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4207768/ghostery-8.12.5.xpi","updateDate":1702559580000},{"id":"uBlock0@raymondhill.net","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/607/607454-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/607/607454-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/607/607454-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"uBlock Origin","version":"1.56.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4237670/ublock_origin-1.56.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin","supportURL":"https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/","description":"Finally, an efficient wide-spectrum content blocker.

As you can see in WebExtensions API documentation or simplified tutorials, there's no way to apply any modifications to a web page without gaining the full access permission to that page. Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n    Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n    Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n    Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n    Identity - required for access to cloud services to allow importing and exporting of styles (e.g. Dropbox, etc).\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.\n\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n    To import styles from Stylish add-on please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n    Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI\n    Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we've kept the \"beta\" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.","weeklyDownloads":2286,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Stylus Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13438734/"},"developers":[{"name":"Jeremy Schomery","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11568224/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184539.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":517,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184539.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":394,"caption":"Promo"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184538.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184538.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Editor"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200986.png?modified=1622132705","width":843,"height":597,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200986.jpg?modified=1622132705","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":377,"caption":"Manager - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200987.png?modified=1622132709","width":970,"height":865,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200987.jpg?modified=1622132709","thumbnailWidth":449,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Editor - showing RegExp tester and colorpicker"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200985.png?modified=1622132711","width":538,"height":610,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200985.jpg?modified=1622132711","thumbnailWidth":353,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200988.png?modified=1622132713","width":576,"height":727,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200988.jpg?modified=1622132713","thumbnailWidth":317,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - finding styles"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6727,"reviewCount":314,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/reviews/","updateDate":1707380293000},{"id":"{74145f27-f039-47ce-a470-a662b129930a}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/839/839767-32.png?modified=b06fa7ed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/839/839767-64.png?modified=b06fa7ed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/839/839767-128.png?modified=b06fa7ed"},"name":"ClearURLs","version":"1.26.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4064884/clearurls-1.26.1.xpi","homepageURL":"https://clearurls.xyz/","supportURL":"https://docs.clearurls.xyz","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/","description":"Removes tracking elements from URLs","fullDescription":"This extension will automatically remove tracking elements from URLs to help protect your privacy when browsing through the Internet.\n\nMany websites use tracking elements in the URL (e.g. https://example.com?utm_source=newsletter1&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sale) to mark your online activity. All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs.

Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents ETag tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy. We do not—and will never—collect any of your usage data.\n\nWhat do I do if I have trouble?\nVisit our GitLab page or check out our wiki.\n\nWrite us...\nIf have any suggestions or complaints, please contact us on GitLab.\n\nPermissions\nReasoning for needed permissions can be found under here.\n\nContributors\n\n    Kevin Röbert (creator/developer)\n    Yi-Ping Huang (translator)\n    rayman89 (translator)\n    Ramon Santilli (translator)\n    Lucifer (translator)\n    Shitennouji (translator)\n    perdolka (contributor)\n    Nameless (contributor)\n    a-polivanchuk (translator)\n    hydrargyrum (translator)\n    alekksander (translator)\n    Zoltan Toldy (translator)\n    tartpvule (contributor)\n    Giovanni (translator)\n    U.
